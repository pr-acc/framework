# Framework for the Privacy Robustness Accelerationism (PR/ACC)

Hi everyone! Thanks for dropping by ðŸ˜Š

Hereâ€™s our early attempt at building a framework to evaluate how much **privacy** & **robustness** each protocol actually provides. Itâ€™s a work in progress â€” and weâ€™d really love your thoughts on

- The current criteria
- Suggestions for new criteria
- Or any other general thoughts

Feel free to Pull Request any input you can share. We really appreciate

For now, you can also suggest re-evaluation of supported protocol's score or scoring of new protocols in Issues.

Letâ€™s accelerate Privacy Robustness together!
